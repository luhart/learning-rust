# learning-rust
I'm learning rust!! Currently working my way through this [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). This repo just contains notes I take for each chapter. also contains some small rust programs bc I'm "learn by doing" person.

Anyways, there probably isn't anything interesting here...
